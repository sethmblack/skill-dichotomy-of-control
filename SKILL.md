# Dichotomy of Control Analysis

Separate any situation into what is within your control versus what is outside it, to focus energy and reduce anxiety.

---

## When to Use

- Feeling overwhelmed or anxious about a situation
- Wasting energy on things you cannot change
- Paralyzed by uncertainty about outcomes
- Stressed about other people's behavior or opinions
- User asks "What can I control?" or "I'm so stressed about X"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The situation causing distress or anxiety |
| concerns | Yes | Specific worries or sources of stress |
| desired_outcome | No | What the person hopes will happen |

## The Stoic Framework

The Dichotomy of Control is the cornerstone of Stoic philosophy. As Epictetus taught:

> "Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions."

### What Is Within Your Control

**Always within control:**
- Your judgments and opinions about events
- Your values and what you care about
- Your intentions and efforts
- Your responses to what happens
- How you treat others
- Your character and virtue

### What Is Outside Your Control

**Never within control:**
- Other people's thoughts, feelings, actions
- External events and circumstances
- Outcomes of your efforts
- The past
- Natural phenomena
- How others perceive you

### The Key Insight

Suffering arises from caring too much about what we cannot control while neglecting what we can. Peace comes from reversing this—focusing all energy on what's within our power while accepting the rest.

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: List All Concerns
Enumerate everything causing stress about the situation. Don't filter—capture all worries.

### Step 2: Sort Into Two Columns

**Within Your Control:**
- Your effort and preparation
- Your attitude and mindset
- How you respond
- Your integrity throughout

**Outside Your Control:**
- Others' decisions
- External circumstances
- Final outcomes
- Events beyond your influence

### Step 3: Identify Disguised Controllables
Some things seem uncontrollable but have controllable elements:
- "Getting the job" (uncontrollable) → "Preparing thoroughly" (controllable)
- "Being liked" (uncontrollable) → "Being kind and authentic" (controllable)
- "Succeeding" (uncontrollable) → "Giving full effort" (controllable)

### Step 4: Create Action Plan
For each controllable item, define a specific action.

### Step 5: Create Acceptance Statement
For uncontrollable items, practice acceptance: "I accept that X is not within my power. I release my attachment to controlling it."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Dichotomy of Control Analysis

### Situation
[Brief description of the situation]

### Within Your Control

| Concern | Controllable Element | Action |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| [Worry] | [What you can actually do] | [Specific action] |

### Outside Your Control

| Concern | Why Uncontrollable | Acceptance |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| [Worry] | [Reason] | [Statement releasing attachment] |

### Focus Shift
**Release:** [What to stop spending energy on]
**Focus:** [Where to direct energy instead]

### The Stoic Reminder
[Relevant Marcus Aurelius quote]

### Your Action Plan
1. [Immediate controllable action]
2. [Next controllable action]
3. [Ongoing controllable practice]
```

---

## Constraints

- Do not pretend things are controllable when they're not
- Do not minimize legitimate concerns
- The goal is clarity, not toxic positivity
- Acceptance is not approval—you can accept reality while working to change what you can
- Some situations may reveal that very little is controllable, and that's okay

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm anxious about my startup's funding round. We're talking to VCs but I keep worrying about what they think of us, whether they'll invest, and what happens if we run out of money."

**Output:**

## Dichotomy of Control Analysis

### Situation
Seeking venture capital funding for startup; experiencing anxiety about investor decisions and potential failure.

### Within Your Control

| Concern | Controllable Element | Action |
|---------|---------------------|--------|
| VC meetings | Quality of your pitch | Rehearse until excellent; get feedback |
| What VCs think | What you communicate | Be honest, clear, and prepared |
| Investment decision | Your effort and follow-up | Provide requested info promptly |
| Running out of money | Financial management now | Extend runway; reduce burn where possible |
| Running out of money | Having alternatives | Explore parallel funding paths |

### Outside Your Control

| Concern | Why Uncontrollable | Acceptance |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| VC's final decision | Their criteria, portfolio, timing | I accept that investors decide based on factors beyond my control |
| What VCs think of us | Others' opinions are theirs | I accept that perceptions are not mine to control |
| Market conditions | Macro environment | I accept that timing affects outcomes regardless of merit |
| Whether startup survives | Too many variables | I accept that giving my best is all I can do |

### Focus Shift
**Release:** Obsessing over VC responses, reading into email tone, imagining their internal discussions
**Focus:** Pitch quality, financial fundamentals, exploring alternatives, doing work worth funding

### The Stoic Reminder
> "You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength." — Marcus Aurelius

### Your Action Plan
1. This week: Perfect the pitch; role-play tough questions
2. Today: Review financials; identify realistic runway extension options
3. Ongoing: Focus meeting energy on clear communication, not on reading reactions
4. Parallel: Research alternative funding (grants, angels, revenue)

This skill is part of the **Marcus Aurelius** expert persona. It addresses the most common source of human suffering: directing energy toward what we cannot control while neglecting what we can.
